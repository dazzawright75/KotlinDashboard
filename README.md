# Dashboard

Simple dashboard application to draw circular progress bar on screen using data from a given endpoint.

I kept the implementation simple and used a minimal SQLuie DB containing only the data needed for this. IN reality it would have a lot more.

## Built With

* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For making async API calls.

## Testing

This proved to be the biggest block and I wasn't able to get this working correctly.

Configuring Kotlin to run tests seems a lot more problematic as it actually sets classes etc as they really should be, e.g final, not public
